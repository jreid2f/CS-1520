            <h1 id="htm">My Hobbies</h1>
            
            <p id="hobby">I have quite a few hobbies. I like to play video games and I recently become a fan of Magic the Gathering. For video games, I like to play on Xbox One, Playstation 4, Steam, and Nintendo 3DS. I have played video games since I was a kid so it is always something I enjoy to do in my free time. MTG, I am fairly decent at. I gotten into it by playing with some of my friends from school. Building decks and seeing how I can make them better has always been a fun way to make my time go by. </p>

            <p id="prog">Now, I got into doing programming because of my dad. My dad is a computer programmer himself and probably one of the best I know. Seeing some of the stuff he worked on was always facinating to me. Plus early on he built his own website which was really cool I thought. I got into computers while I was kid and have been around them ever since. I never came into programming on my own. I never knew what I wanted to do but, computers were always my safehaven. I didn't bother learning much about what was inside a computer or how it worked till I got into high school. </p>
